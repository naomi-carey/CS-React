      <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that a second language is your gate way to a second soul. I am
        here to support you in that journey. I am here to expand your horizons
        into the beauty and exciting adventures of a world different than the
        one you know. You can learn new ways of living, discover places, music,
        traditions food and become part of a different culture. I was gifted
        this opportunity and would like to help you experience it too. Teaching
        a language is building bridges of understanding and curiosity to make
        the world more accessible and accepting for everyone.{" "}

        Let’s take this journey together. My commitment is to prioritize your
        needs, interests and goals and to make this experience fun and
        enjoyable. I love teaching, I love sharing with people and I love
        languages. Learning a language broadens your opportunity of connecting
        and empathizing with different people, accessing knowledge in the
        language as it was written and can also provide invaluable job
        opportunities. Nelson Mandela said “If you talk to a man in a language,
        he understands that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own
        language, that goes to his heart.” Let’s develop your new self together.
        I am professional, flexible, committed, creative and a great listener.
